    "- This chatbot is a basic question-answering system for Data Science and AI.\n",
    "- It is built using Pythonâ€™s simple control flow (if/else) statements for keyword-based responses.\n",
    "    - Each if or elif checks whether a keyword (like \"data science\", \"ai\", \"python\") is in the userâ€™s input.\n",
    "    - If a match is found, the chatbot prints the corresponding response.\n",
    "    - If none match, the else clause gives a default reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chatbot works by scanning the input for certain keywords and then branching into the correct response path."
